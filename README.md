##Clearslack: So you can delete your files in bulk.

### How to Use:    
Download the extension [here](). Don't worry, even though it's asking for a lot of permissions, it's not doing anything with your data. Then follow the instructions below

1. Go to this [link](https://matterstudio-c.slack.com/files)
2. Click on the tab that says **My Files**
3. Wait for all of your files to load on the screen
4. Click the extension button in the top right corner (Mine is the black and white S)
5. You should see a box appear over every file that says "Delete File Below", these are similar to check boxes. Full Red means it's ready to delete, white with red outline means it will not delete.
6. Once you're done selecting, click the red button that says Delete Selected Files in the bottom right hand corner.
7. Boom...you're done*

*It's worth noting that the selections you make will not "persist" onto the next page. So if you have more than one page of files, you'll still have to delete them one page at a time.
